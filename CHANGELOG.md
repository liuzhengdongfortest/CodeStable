# Changelog

## 1.0.4

- Hardened CodeStable workflow contracts across Epic dependency admission, Goal authorization, checkpoint resume, independent review, runtime safety, and release gates.

## 1.0.3

- Added the `cs-feedback` evidence pipeline for collecting local Codex and Claude session context, triaging incidents, and producing privacy-safe public issue previews.
- Added candidate-only fixture conversion in the shipped plugin and fail-closed regression fixture promotion in the repository evaluation tooling.
- Hardened current-session discovery, trigger cutoffs, provider-aware tool pairing, public redaction, and upload confirmation gates.

## 1.0.2

- Hardened runtime upgrades: versionless or mismatched manifests now require synchronization, while `/cs-onboard --mode refresh-runtime` refreshes package-owned assets without overwriting dirty managed paths.
- Updated the root `cs` router so action requests dispatch to the target skill in the current run, while advice and overview requests remain non-executing.
- Synchronized Codex and Claude marketplace versions and documented complete-plugin plus per-repository upgrade steps.

## 1.0.1

- CodeStable skill simplification release.

## 1.0.0

- Simplified CodeStable skill entrypoints around main workflow skills and compatibility wrappers.
- Added `cs-feat`, `cs-epic`, and `cs-docs` main entries with explicit `--stage` / `--mode` argument semantics.
- Added long-running goal driver semantics for feature and epic flows, including `/goal` fallback instructions.
- Added workflow scenario coverage and Paseo-agent verification evidence for changed skill workflows.
- Documented partial status for earlier state-machine and manual dogfood reports.

## 0.1.0

- Added the committed CodeStable plugin distribution structure under `plugins/codestable/`.
- Moved CodeStable `cs` / `cs-*` skills to `plugins/codestable/skills/` as the canonical skill source.
- Added Codex and Claude marketplace manifests for local repository installation.
- Added marketplace metadata required by Codex and Claude CLI validation.
- Documented upgrade commands for Codex, Claude, and `skills` CLI users.
- Removed the root-level `browser-bridge` standalone skill from this distribution branch.
