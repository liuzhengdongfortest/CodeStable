**English** · [中文](./README.md)

**An AI coding workflow for serious software engineering**

Tired of OpenSpec's flimsiness, Oh-My-OpenAgent's over-engineering, and Superpowers' fragmentation — I built a lightweight, **human-in-the-loop** AI harness from scratch.

## Install

Codex plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable
codex plugin add codestable@codestable
```

Claude plugin marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable
/plugin install codestable
```

`skills` CLI:

```bash
npx skills@latest add liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable
```

If your `skills` CLI does not discover the plugin entity through the marketplace catalog, use the deep-scan fallback:

```bash
npx skills@latest add liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable --full-depth
```

The CodeStable plugin only packages `cs` / `cs-*` skills under `plugins/codestable/skills/`; other root-level skills such as `browser-bridge` are not part of the CodeStable plugin assets.

## Upgrade

After a new release, check `CHANGELOG.md` for the version changes, then refresh through the entry point you used to install.

Codex plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codestable
codex plugin add codestable@codestable
```

The current Codex CLI has no separate `plugin update` subcommand; `marketplace upgrade` refreshes the Git marketplace snapshot, and `plugin add` installs the current version from that refreshed snapshot.

Claude plugin marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace update
/plugin update codestable@codestable
```

Restart Claude Code after updating so the new plugin version is applied.

`skills` CLI:

```bash
npx skills@latest update
```

If an older installer did not record the source, rerun the `npx skills@latest add liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable` install command above.

One command to start working:

```bash
/cs-onboard
```

For daily use, when you don't know which skill fits, call the root entry:

```bash
/cs
```

`cs` reads your intent and tells you which `cs-xxx` to run.

## Why

I was building a new harness agent ([MA](https://github.com/liuzhengdongfortest/MA)) — vibe-coding at first, just writing designs and requirements while AI wrote the code. It carried most features, until Codex repeatedly failed on a problem I thought was simple, making the same mistake in the same place. That's when I knew the project needed a workflow to keep moving.

I surveyed OpenSpec, SuperPowers, Oh-My-OpenAgent — none felt right:

- **OpenSpec** — too thin, no compounding, specs too abstract for humans to read
- **SuperPowers** — no process discipline, you never know which one to use
- **Oh-My-OpenAgent** — too heavy, philosophically treats "human intervention = failure"

CodeStable's goal is **to solve real software implementation and coding problems for serious engineering** — not to coin a new term or chase trends.

---

## The core difference: what gets orchestrated

Mainstream AI coding frameworks — Superpowers, CCW, Oh-My-OpenAgent — are all doing **the same thing**:

> **Orchestrating agents better.** Get them to team up, collaborate, brainstorm, run pipelines, hand off automatically. The entity at the center is always the **Agent**.

CodeStable goes the **other way**:

> **What gets orchestrated isn't agents — it's the lifecycle of the software itself.** The entities at the center are **the elements that make up software**: every requirement, every architectural decision, every feature, every bug, every constraint left in history.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Agent-orchestration camp</th><th>CodeStable</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Core entity</b></td><td>Agent / Role / Team</td><td>Requirement / Architecture / Feature / Issue / Decision</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Main question</b></td><td>How do agents divide work, hand off, coordinate?</td><td>How do requirements, constraints, decisions get recorded, retrieved, reused?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Where state lives</b></td><td>Agent sessions / message buses / queues</td><td>The <code>codestable/</code> file tree in your project (readable by both humans and AI)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Pain it solves</b></td><td>One agent isn't enough; need coordination to scale</td><td>Software complexity overflows context; tacit knowledge gets lost; requirements drift</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Role of humans</b></td><td>The less the better — full automation is the ideal</td><td>Human-in-the-loop — the programmer owns the whole; AI is an efficient executor</td></tr>
</table>

![](./asset/CodeStableVSAgent.png)

**Neither direction is wrong.**

If your task is "run an end-to-end automated pipeline with AI" or "have multiple agents debate a plan," the agent-orchestration camp fits better.

If your task is "maintain serious software that iterates over years" or "make sure a requirement written today can still be accurately recalled three months later" — then CodeStable's software-element-centric model fits better.

I built CodeStable because I believe **the chaos of software engineering isn't really about agents not being strong enough — it's about elements not being organized**. No matter how strong the agent, it can't save a project that's lost its requirements, architecture, and history.

## Design: entities + flows

CodeStable models real coding work as a set of **entities** and **flows**.

### Entities

| Entity | Slug | What it does |
|------|------|--------|
| **Requirement** | requirements | User stories + domain glossary (CONTEXT.md) + architecture decisions (ADRs). The escape hatch — when code rots, you can throw it all out and let AI regenerate from these |
| **Roadmap** | roadmap | "I want a permission system" — too big to throw at AI as a feature; cut it into a roadmap and advance step by step |
| **Goal** | goals | Bounded start/end: write a start report, then let AI iterate autonomously on implementation/validation, with subagent functional acceptance before completion |
| **Feature** | feature | The actual engineering execution. Human and AI collaborate, jointly responsible for design / implementation / acceptance |
| **Issue** | issue | The bug list after release. AI and human solve it together |
| **Refactor** | refactor | Cleanup process when code rots (beta) |
| **Compound** | compound | The compounding-engineering knowledge base — pitfalls, tricks, investigation notes |

### Flows

| Flow | Key skill chain | Notes |
|------|------------|------|
| **Feature delivery** | `cs-feat` → `cs-feat-design` → `cs-feat-design-review` → `cs-feat-impl` → `cs-code-review` → `cs-feat-qa` → `cs-feat-accept` | Think it through → design review → step-by-step coding → code review → QA → acceptance |
| **Goal achievement** | `cs-goal` | Bounded start/end → interview/grill + start report → autonomous implement/validate/iterate → subagent functional acceptance before completion |
| **Issue fixing** | `cs-issue-report` → `cs-issue-analyze` → `cs-issue-fix` → `cs-code-review` | Tell AI what's wrong → AI finds the root cause → AI fixes precisely → independent review before commit |
| **Refactoring** | `cs-refactor` (beta) → `cs-code-review` | Architectural rot doesn't happen overnight. AI assists, but **humans refactor**. Still iterating — feedback welcome |

`cs-code-review` is the cross-cutting quality gate at the tail of every execution flow, before commit — feature, fast path, issue fixing, and refactoring all route their pre-commit diff review through it. At a phase or milestone boundary, use `cs-docs-neat` to reconcile `.codestable/`, README/docs, `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, and agent memory so docs do not drift from code.

> Strong branch protection: `cs-onboard` can optionally release the `codestable-ai-branch-guard` hook, which blocks AI from implementing directly on `main`/`master` and forces a worktree. See the "branch protection hook" section in `cs-onboard`.

## Workflow at a glance

CodeStable's skills are **layered + event-driven**: root routing, onboard, long-lived archives, roadmap planning, feature / issue / refactor execution flows, and cross-cut knowledge sinking.

- Vertical means layers, not strict time order; long-lived archives are refreshed repeatedly, while the roadmap layer is entered for large needs.
- `cs-feat-design-review`, `cs-code-review`, and `cs-feat-qa` are explicit gates; blocking findings route work back to the matching stage.
- Execution is event-driven: new capability goes to feature flow, bugs go to issue flow, rot goes to refactor flow, and bounded outcomes go to goal flow.
- The cross-cut layer compounds knowledge: `cs-keep` records reusable experience, `cs-note` stores small project conventions, and `cs-docs-neat` reconciles docs at milestone boundaries.

See [WORKFLOW.en.md](./WORKFLOW.en.md) for the fuller workflow and runtime model.

---

## Runtime structure

After `/cs-onboard`, a `.codestable/` directory appears at your project root as the aggregate root for requirements, roadmap, goals, features, issues, refactors, audits, compound, tools, hooks, and reference.

Key points:

- All workflow artifacts aggregate under `.codestable/`, so "how did we handle that feature / bug last time" is three seconds away.
- `requirements/` is the long-lived archive, `roadmap/` is the planning layer, and `features/` / `issues/` / `refactors/` are per-run execution records.
- `compound/` is the single knowledge sink: plain markdown, no frontmatter, searched via `grep -r`.
- `reference/` is copied in by `cs-onboard`; to change shared conventions, edit the templates under `plugins/codestable/skills/cs-onboard/reference/` so new projects pick them up at onboard time.

### Hard constraint

> A skill is an independent install unit. At runtime, **each skill can only see files inside its own package**. References like `B-skill/reference/xxx.md` written in skill A's SKILL.md are **simply unreachable** at runtime.
>
> Cross-skill shared references must go through the "working project" layer: `cs-onboard` copies them from the skill package to the project's `codestable/reference/`, and other skills read them via the project-relative path.

To change shared conventions, edit the templates under `plugins/codestable/skills/cs-onboard/reference/`; new projects pick them up at onboard time. See [WORKFLOW.en.md](./WORKFLOW.en.md) for the full directory model and cross-skill reference constraints.

## Design philosophy

CodeStable takes the **opposite** philosophy from OMO:

- OMO says: any human intervention is a failure signal
- CodeStable says: **the programmer is in the loop of software coding** — you may not understand the black-box implementation, but you must own the whole, and dive in when needed

Software architecture must be **evolvable**, **observable**, **controllable**.

This may matter less as AI gets stronger, but **right now this makes programmers comfortable in reality** — and that's the value.

CodeStable is modeled for real-world development scenarios, aiming to handle common dev problems through a closed-loop system. **Most existing frameworks model around AI, not around humans.** I think their authors have strong AI-driving skills but aren't seriously building software — they lack the basic ability to organize requirements and design, and they lack respect for code implementation.

---

## Roadmap

CodeStable adapts to model capability. If a future model nails a module reliably, that module gets removed.

- [ ] Refactor flow needs hardening (`cs-refactor` is still beta)
- [ ] …

Issues welcome — share your real-world dev pain and refactoring experience.
