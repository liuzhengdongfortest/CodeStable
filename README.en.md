**An AI coding workflow for serious software engineering**

Tired of OpenSpec's flimsiness, Oh-My-OpenAgent's over-engineering, and Superpowers' fragmentation — I built a lightweight, **human-in-the-loop** AI harness from scratch.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/liuzhengdongfortest/CodeStable
```

One command to start working:

```bash
/cs-onboard
```

For daily use, when you don't know which skill fits, call the root entry:

```bash
/cs
```

`cs` reads your intent and tells you which `cs-xxx` to run.

---

## Why

I was building a new harness agent ([MA](https://github.com/liuzhengdongfortest/MA)) — vibe-coding at first, just writing designs and requirements while AI wrote the code. It carried most features, until Codex repeatedly failed on a problem I thought was simple, making the same mistake in the same place. That's when I knew the project needed a workflow to keep moving.

I surveyed OpenSpec, SuperPowers, Oh-My-OpenAgent — none felt right:

- **OpenSpec** — too thin, no compounding, specs too abstract for humans to read
- **SuperPowers** — no process discipline, you never know which one to use
- **Oh-My-OpenAgent** — too heavy, philosophically treats "human intervention = failure"

CodeStable's goal is **to solve real software implementation and coding problems for serious engineering** — not to coin a new term or chase trends.

---

## The core difference: what gets orchestrated

Mainstream AI coding frameworks — Superpowers, CCW, Oh-My-OpenAgent — are all doing **the same thing**:

> **Orchestrating agents better.** Get them to team up, collaborate, brainstorm, run pipelines, hand off automatically. The entity at the center is always the **Agent**.

CodeStable goes the **other way**:

> **What gets orchestrated isn't agents — it's the lifecycle of the software itself.** The entities at the center are **the elements that make up software**: every change, every trade-off, every rejected alternative, every constraint left in history.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Agent-orchestration camp</th><th>CodeStable</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Core entity</b></td><td>Agent / Role / Team</td><td>Work items (issues / epics) · requirements (needs / constraints / trade-offs)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Main question</b></td><td>How do agents divide work, hand off, coordinate?</td><td>How do requirements, constraints, trade-offs get recorded, retrieved, reused?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Where state lives</b></td><td>Agent sessions / message buses / queues</td><td>The <code>.cs/</code> file tree (readable by both humans and AI)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Pain it solves</b></td><td>One agent isn't enough; need coordination to scale</td><td>Software complexity overflows context; tacit knowledge gets lost; requirements drift</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Role of humans</b></td><td>The less the better — full automation is the ideal</td><td>Human-in-the-loop — the programmer owns the whole; AI is an efficient executor</td></tr>
</table>

**Neither direction is wrong.**

If your task is "run an end-to-end automated pipeline with AI" or "have multiple agents debate a plan," the agent-orchestration camp fits better.

If your task is "maintain serious software that iterates over years" or "make sure a requirement written today can still be accurately recalled three months later" — then CodeStable's software-element-centric model fits better.

I built CodeStable because I believe **the chaos of software engineering isn't really about agents not being strong enough — it's about elements not being organized**. No matter how strong the agent, it can't save a project that's lost its requirements, trade-offs, and history.

## Design: work items + requirements

Early CodeStable split development into 6 entities and 3 pipelines. In practice that was too many entities and too rigid — feature / issue / refactor are really the same thing (a closeable work item), and requirements / roadmap / architecture all describe the same thing (the current requirements truth). So it collapsed into **work items plus requirements**.

### Work items — things to do that get closed

Bugs, refactors, small features, big needs — they're all "a change to make that gets closed when done," just differing in size and type. They live in `.cs/issues/` or `.cs/epics/`.

- **`cs-plan`** — bridge from `talks/`: small needs become issues directly; larger needs enter epics first and get split into issues
- **`cs-complain`** — when behavior breaks expectations, pin expected/actual/repro/evidence and create a bug issue
- **`cs-design`** — implementation design for a single issue: module ownership, interfaces/data/state, test surface, and execution order
- **`cs-test`** — optional test design for one issue when the user or company requires test cases and execution guidance
- **`cs-do`** — implement from the issue design, verify, and write back the execution record
- **`cs-close`** — close an issue and write durable conclusions back to requirements, notes, facts, or tools
- **`cs-issue`** — one closeable change, tagged `bug` / `refactor` / `feature` / `chore`. Loop: record clearly → locate → fix + verify → close & write back
- **`cs-epics`** — too big for a single issue: settle the architecture in epics first (module split + interface contracts), then break it into a dependency-DAG of issues
- **`cs-audit`** — proactive scanner + reconciliation against requirements, producing a triage list; selected findings become issues

### requirements — needs, constraints, trade-offs

This is CodeStable's north star: **read it and you know the requirements, constraints, and trade-offs behind the code.** It only records what the code itself can't show — why this, why not that, the rejected alternatives, which user stories must hold, which boundaries vary. Code says "what it does," requirements fills in "why it must be this way"; together they're the full picture, neither repeating the other.

- **`cs-requirements`** — current needs, constraints, domain glossary, and rationale notes (happy path / boundaries / why flexibility is needed). No code locations, no historical narrative

### How they mesh

Work items are the increments; requirements is the current requirements truth those increments settle into. **When an issue or epic closes, the graduated constraints, facts, and trade-offs are written back to requirements.** Requirements keeps no history (that lives in closed issues); issues don't describe the standing requirements. The execution discipline (`cs-do`) and notes (`cs-keep`) serve both.

## Workflow at a glance

CodeStable isn't a single linear pipeline — it's **work items + requirements + event-driven**:

```

```

**How to read this diagram:**

- **Work items and requirements are not a time order** — open new work any time; requirements is refreshed as work items close
- **Work items are the increments, requirements is the sediment**: when an issue or epic closes, the graduated trade-offs are written back to requirements
- **Support files are the flywheel**: any work item that surfaces something worth keeping triggers a sink; the next round of work reads it back — the physical implementation of CodeStable's "compounding"

## Runtime structure

After `/cs-onboard`, a `.cs/` directory appears at your project root — the aggregate root for all local artifacts and the only workspace each skill reads/writes at runtime.

```
your-project/
├── .cs/
│   ├── facts.md              # Startup facts
│   ├── talks/                # Discussion synthesis (cs-talk, lazy)
│   │
│   ├── issues/               # Small work items, sharded by creation year/month
│   │   └── YYYY/MM/{slug}.md
│   ├── epics/                # Large work-item planning
│   │   └── YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md
│   │
│   ├── requirements/         # Current needs, constraints, and trade-offs (cs-requirements)
│   │   ├── REQUIREMENTS.md   # Entry point (lazy)
│   │   ├── REQUIREMENTS-MAP.md # Multi-requirements topology entry (large projects only)
│   │   └── {slug}.md         # One area per file
│   │
│   ├── notes/                # Knowledge notes, plain markdown, full-text search (cs-keep)
│   │   └── YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md
│   │
│   └── tools/                # Cross-workflow shared scripts (added by cs-maketools as needed)
│
└── (work items stay under .cs/ by default so humans and AI can both read and edit them)
```

**Key points:**

- All local artifacts aggregate under `.cs/`, so "how did we handle that change last time" is three seconds away
- `requirements/` holds current needs, constraints, domain language, and trade-offs; it describes only the current truth with no historical narrative; history lives in closed issues
- Issues default to local `issues/YYYY/MM/{slug}.md`, avoiding too many files in one directory; search recursively under `issues/`
- `notes/` is the knowledge notes area — plain markdown, no frontmatter, full-text searchable. Easy to write, easy to find
- `cs-maketools` turns human-guided unknown workflows into `notes/`, adds a `facts.md` reference, and only writes `tools/` when automation is stable
- When one Markdown file exceeds 150 lines, split by progressive disclosure into same-directory resources instead of hard-compressing the entry file

### Hard constraint

> A skill is an independent install unit. At runtime, **each skill can only see files inside its own package**. References like `B-skill/reference/xxx.md` written in skill A's SKILL.md are **simply unreachable** at runtime.
>
> Do not solve cross-skill system rules by making skills reference each other's files. Keep system rules inside the `cs` skill, or sink project-specific stable knowledge into `.cs/requirements/`, `.cs/notes/`, and `.cs/facts.md`.

Each cs action skill first checks the `cs` skill: reuse it if it has already been read in the current conversation or execution context; otherwise read it once to load the entity and skill boundaries.

To change system rules, update the `cs` skill and its references/templates; project-specific stable needs and operating knowledge belong in the matching `.cs/` entities.

## Design philosophy

CodeStable takes the **opposite** philosophy from OMO:

- OMO says: any human intervention is a failure signal
- CodeStable says: **the programmer is in the loop of software coding** — you may not understand the black-box implementation, but you must own the whole, and dive in when needed

Software architecture must be **evolvable**, **observable**, **controllable**.

This may matter less as AI gets stronger, but **right now this makes programmers comfortable in reality** — and that's the value.

CodeStable is modeled for real-world development scenarios, aiming to handle common dev problems through a closed-loop system. **Most existing frameworks model around AI, not around humans.** I think their authors have strong AI-driving skills but aren't seriously building software — they lack the basic ability to organize requirements and design, and they lack respect for code implementation.

---

## Roadmap

CodeStable adapts to model capability. If a future model nails a module reliably, that module gets removed.

- [ ] Polish the local work-item flow
- [ ] Harden `cs-audit`'s reconciliation against requirements
- [ ] …

Issues welcome — share your real-world dev pain and refactoring experience.
