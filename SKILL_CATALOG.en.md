# CodeStable Skill Catalog

Main entries accept optional stage / mode flags (for example `/cs-feat --stage qa`, `/cs-refactor --mode fastforward`, `/cs-docs --mode api auth-endpoints`). Flags are only intent hints; repository facts always win, bare arguments always describe the task, and no-argument calls recover or route from repository facts plus the user's words.
